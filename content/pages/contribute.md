This site is made to share and everybody is invited to do so!

Adding to this site
=======================

Everybody is heartily encouraged to add his or her knowledge/experience/opinion by forking [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/baSSHtion/baSSHtion.github.io), and submitting a pull request.

Tutorials, tips&tricks, etc. are welcome as well.

Adding to solutions
===================


Bugfixes, new features, more documentation an/or test are welcome additions to all projects. Here is how to share:

1. Fork the repository of the solution
2. Add your changes. Update/create tests where applicable.
3. Update the README
4. Open a pull request, and state that you put the change under the same license as the original license.


Adding a new repository
==============================

New solutions in dedicated repositories can either be added to the basshtion.org, or just be linked to from the website.

Linking to existing repositories/sites
---------------------------------

New repositories/sites can be linked to from the website. This is a good idea, if you want to add a reference to existing project that either does not belong to you, or that you do not want to move to basshtion.org.


Adding new repositories
---------------------------------

If you want to add a repository to the basshtion.org organisation on GitHub, please contact me via GitHub. The only requirements are that the repository fits theme wise (*ssh*), and the license fits. Preferred are licenses that easily allow the corporate users to use the solution, and contribute to it. E.g. BSD 2/3-clause, APL, etc.
